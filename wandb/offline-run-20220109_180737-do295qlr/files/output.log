WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/tbcnn/net.py:98: auc (from tensorflow.python.ops.metrics_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
The value of AUC returned by this may race with the update so this is deprecated. Please use tf.keras.metrics.AUC instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/tbcnn/train_loop.py:46: shuffle_and_repeat (from tensorflow.python.data.experimental.ops.shuffle_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use `tf.data.Dataset.shuffle(buffer_size, seed)` followed by `tf.data.Dataset.repeat(count)`. Static tf.data optimizations will take care of using the fused implementation.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/tensorflow/python/autograph/impl/api.py:465: py_func (from tensorflow.python.ops.script_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
tf.py_func is deprecated in TF V2. Instead, there are two
    options available in V2.
    - tf.py_function takes a python function which manipulates tf eager
    tensors instead of numpy arrays. It's easy to convert a tf eager tensor to
    an ndarray (just call tensor.numpy()) but having access to eager tensors
    means `tf.py_function`s can use accelerators such as GPUs as well as
    being differentiable using a gradient tape.
    - tf.numpy_function maintains the semantics of the deprecated tf.py_func
    (it is not differentiable, and manipulates numpy arrays). It drops the
    stateful argument making all functions stateful.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /content/tbcnn/train_loop.py:51: DatasetV1.make_one_shot_iterator (from tensorflow.python.data.ops.dataset_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This is a deprecated API that should only be used in TF 1 graph mode and legacy TF 2 graph mode available through `tf.compat.v1`. In all other situations -- namely, eager mode and inside `tf.function` -- you can consume dataset elements using `for elem in dataset: ...` or by explicitly creating iterator via `iterator = iter(dataset)` and fetching its elements via `values = next(iterator)`. Furthermore, this API is not available in TF 2. During the transition from TF 1 to TF 2 you can use `tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(dataset)` to create a TF 1 graph mode style iterator for a dataset created through TF 2 APIs. Note that this should be a transient state of your code base as there are in general no guarantees about the interoperability of TF 1 and TF 2 code.
